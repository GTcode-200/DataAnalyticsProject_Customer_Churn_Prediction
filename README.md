# DataAnalyticsProject_Customer_Churn_Prediction

The primary problem our team intends to address is to investigate and give you a predictive version for predicting Credit Card Customer Churn so as to aid corporations tormented by customer churn such that they could hit upon Churning Customers as early as feasible and might take essential movement so as to maintain the Churning Customers
<br>

To use this project, clone this repository into your local machines and run the following file to get all results at one place
```
Credit_Card_Customer_Churn_Prediction_EDA_Model_Building_and_Predictions.ipynb
```
This file consists of all the codes starting from EDA to model building and validation
<br>

The model used here was a voting classifier consisting of the following:
1.	AdaBoost
2.	Gradient Boosting Classifier
3.	Random Forest Classifier(RF)
4.	Extra Trees Classifier
5.	Decision Tree Classifier(DT)
6.	Support Vector Machine(SVM)
7.	Bagging Classifier
<br>

The files under Temp docs are docs not submitted but could be considered also <br>

If the code is run on google colab/ kaggle
**Make sure you have the .csv file uploaded into the session and placed at the required place** <br>
